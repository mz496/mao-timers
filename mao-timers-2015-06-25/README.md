MAO Timers
==========

About
-----

These timers are designed for Mu Alpha Theta (http://www.mualphatheta.org) competitions. They should be intuitive enough to use with a little background knowledge of how the competitions are run. If you don't know how Mu Alpha Theta competitions are run, try the link on the page.

Offline mode
------------

The app can also be used offline with the compressed file in the main directory. I haven't experienced any issues myself, but I'm not sure what differences can arise from running offline, so please take that into account. There is also a possibility that old versions of the offline files will still circulate after the app has been updated, so please be sure to verify the date in the file name.

Changes in offline version:
- A dependency is loaded locally instead of connecting to a URL to retrieve it (jQuery)
- The main script and stylesheet are minified (obfuscated) to prevent tampering
- Everything else is copied verbatim, and everything should work the same

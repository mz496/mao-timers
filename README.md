MAO Timers
==========

These timers are designed for Mu Alpha Theta (http://www.mualphatheta.org) competitions. They should be intuitive enough to use with a little background knowledge of how the competitions are run. If you don't know how Mu Alpha Theta competitions are run, try the link on the page.
